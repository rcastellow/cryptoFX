This application will complete the following steps:
1. poll listed exchanges for prices
2. apply the algorithm
3. Make buy/sell decisions based on the given ruleset.
4. Execute a trade



Goals:
1. automate the trade of alt-currencies from ? to BTC
2. Begin running mean reversion algortihm on alt currency of choice
3. Address periodic syncing intervals (timer module?)
4. Finish a module in the diagram above (email and or graph)
5. Build a module that deicdes how much to wager (Kelly Criterion module, etc)
6. Add license text

...
1. Make floating windows more configurable on the mean reversion algorithm
2. Build an algorithm to take advantage of price differences across multiple exchanges
3. Build a web interface using pylon
4. Setup graphs

TTD:
1. Add buy/sell methods to all current exchanges
2. Move algorithm logic completely to its own module
