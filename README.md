CryptoFX is a cryptocurrency trader of various crypto currencies.

Each functionality is broken into modules including:
1. algorithms
2. exchange plugins
3. graph plugins
4. reports
5. statistics and common math libraries
6. timer plugins


There is only 1 algorithm currently, which is the mean-reversion plugin.  The mean reversion plugin will buy
currencies when the price goes below the X day moving average and sell the currency when the price goes above the 
X day moving average.

Future enhancements:
1. Setup graphs
2. Build a pylon web interface
3. Build more algorithm plugins
4. Build a plugin for emails/texts
